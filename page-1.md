## Bug Bounty Program

The ENS bug bounty program rewards anyone who finds a bug in covered ENS smart contracts.

### Rules and Rewards <a href="#rules-and-rewards" id="rules-and-rewards"></a>

* Issues that have already been submitted by another user or are already known to the ENS team are not eligible for bounty rewards.
* Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty. This includes exploiting the bug on mainnet or any public test network.
* The ENS team, employees and all other people paid by ENS project, directly or indirectly, are not eligible for rewards.
* Only the smart contracts listed below are eligible for rewards. Websites and other infrastructure are not covered by the bounty program.
* The ENS bounty program considers a number of variables in determining rewards. Determinations of eligibility, score and all terms related to an award are at the sole and final discretion of the ENS team.

The value of rewards paid out will vary depending on Severity. The severity is calculated according to the OWASP risk rating model based on Impact and Likelihood :![](https://464911102-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-LZWNj0\_mU4\_3ENJbw83%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-1ec7454ecbacadf9b012c80d0ccf75eeba5fe451%2Fowasp\_w600.png?alt=media)Reward sizes are _guided_ by the rules below, but are in the end, determined at the sole discretion of the ENS team
